# Advanced Tile Card for Lovelace [üöß under construction üöß]

## Inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è

- This card is heavily inspired by [matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707) [hass-config](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) config and the main reason I created this card
- This was done using the [Boilerplate Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/boilerplate-card) by [@iantrich](https://www.github.com/iantrich).

## Installation via HACS

HACS installation: Go to the hacs store and add a custom repo url https://github.com/s1rd4v3/advanced-tile-card to install.

_TBD_

- add theme installation instructions
  - add image installation instructions

## Features

- Add custom actions for icon taps or default taps
- Entities with pictures (like camera, person or media_players) can add the picture to the icon or to the background

  - Entity attribute can be used instead of state string (like `media_title` for `media_player` domain)
