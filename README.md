# Advanced Tile Card for Lovelace [üöß under construction üöß]
> This card is for my personal usage primarely and not ready for production. So feel free to reuse!

## Inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è
- This card is heavily inspired by [matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707) [hass-config](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) config and the main reason I created this card 
- This was done using the [Boilerplate Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/boilerplate-card) by [@iantrich](https://www.github.com/iantrich).

## Features
- Add custom actions for icon taps or default taps
- Entities with pictures (like camera, person or media_players) can add the picture to the icon or to the background


## Installation via HACS
HACS installation: Go to the hacs store and add a custom repo url https://github.com/s1rd4v3/advanced-tile-card to install.

_TBD_
- add theme installation instructions
  - add image installation instructions
- add screenshot
