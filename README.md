# Advanced Tile Card for Lovelace [under heavy construction üöß]
> This card is not yet ready for production

## Inspiration ‚ù§Ô∏è
This card is heavily inspired by [matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707) [hass-config](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config) config and the main reason I created this card so I am able to add and modify cards easier than using yaml files. This was done using the [Boilerplate Card](https://github.com/custom-cards/boilerplate-card) by [@iantrich](https://www.github.com/iantrich).

## Installation via HACS
HACS installation: Go to the hacs store and add a custom repo url https://github.com/s1rd4v3/advanced-tile-card to install.
